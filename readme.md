# Playwright (TS binding) + Cucumber (BDD)

Cucumber is a popular behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that allows developers and stakeholders to collaborate on defining and testing application requirements in a human-readable format. 
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, making it easier to catch errors before runtime. By combining these two tools, we can create more reliable and maintainable tests.
